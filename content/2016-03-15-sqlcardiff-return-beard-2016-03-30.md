Just a quick heads up to peeps in and around Cardiff, Wales. Later this month we&#8217;re holding [Battle of the Beards: Return of the Beard][1]. Fantastic speakers with resplendent beards are joining us for our 6 sq. ft of pizza to present on advanced SQL Tricks, using PowerBI as a DBA, and stepping up to the challenge of the last minute audit.

This is a great chance to meet folks interested in the Microsoft Data Platform and learn from some incredibly knowledgable speakers. If Cardiff isn&#8217;t local and you&#8217;d like to attend one closer to home, check out [UK SQL user groups][2] or search internationally on [the PASS site][3].
