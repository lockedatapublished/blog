This second part of the 'Python for Data Scientists' post talks about
the specifics of Python for data scientists. Part 1 of Python for Data
Scientists talks about Python generally and can be found
[here](https://itsalocke.com/blog/introducing-python-for-data-scientists---pt1/).

Python for data scientists
==========================

Where you can use Python
------------------------

Python is a general purpose programming language meaning that is has
many use cases outside of data science. These include gaming, graphics,
web development, GIS, and control systems among others. A benefit of
this is that data analytics undertaken with Python can easily be
integrated with other tools. Python is an easy language to learn and the
capability of Python for advanced analytics is quickly growing. Here's a
data visualisation video that uses Python:

Key packages for data science
-----------------------------

The packages mentioned in [Part 1](https://itsalocke.com/blog/introducing-python-for-data-scientists---pt1/) are all used
extensively for data science. Additional useful packages are:

-   [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - data visualizations
-   [ggplot](http://ggplot.yhathq.com/) - graphical plotting based on
    R's ggplot2
-   [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - statistical model
    visualizations
-   [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) - interactive
    visualizations
-   [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) - Web based toolbox for web
    visualizations
-   [SciKit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org) - machine learning and image
    processing
-   [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) - machine
    learning framework
-   [Keras](https://keras.io/) - high-level neural networks
-   [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) - Natural Language processing
-   [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) - web crawling framework
-   [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) -
    estimation of statistical models and conducting statistical tests
    and data exploration

Important things to learn
-------------------------

Learning to use the previously mentioned packages is essential for using
Python for data science.

Python is an interpreted language (as opposed to being compiled) and is
a dynamically-typed. Both of these features lend themselves to some of
Python's strengths and also its weaknesses.

Iteration is an important feature in Python which contrasts to
vectorisation in R (if you come from a R background).

Using Python with virtual environments is another key concept to learn
about. The main idea here is that the way that Python packages are
stored on your computer can cause problems when working on multiple
projects. A way to get around these problems is to use virtual
environments. More information on this can be found
[here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) and
[here](https://realpython.com/blog/python/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)
