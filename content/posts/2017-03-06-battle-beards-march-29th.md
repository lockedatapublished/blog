I need your help.

Battle of the Beards is an annual tech event in Cardiff that&#8217;s previously been an evening affair but is now a day-long conference. We&#8217;re hosting half-hour talks on security, infrastructure, software craftmanship, front-end development, and data visualisation. We&#8217;re starting out the day with bacon baps and it just gets better from there. Tickets cost £15 and there&#8217;s the option to add a donation to the charity we&#8217;re supporting with the event, the [Campaign Against Living Miserably][1].

Right now ticket sales are really low and without your help, we&#8217;ll have to cancel the event.

I&#8217;m hoping you can help make this event succeed by doing one or both of two things:

  * <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://battleofthebeards.eventbrite.co.uk">register</a></strong></span> if it&#8217;s of interest to you
  * recommend it to others

\[button text=&#8221;REGISTER&#8221; color=&#8221;orange&#8221; link=&#8221;https://battleofthebeards.eventbrite.co.uk&#8221;\] \[button text=&#8221;TWEET&#8221; color=&#8221;blue&#8221; link=&#8221;https://twitter.com/home?status=Hey%20%23tweeps%20-%20%23battleofthebeards%20is%20on%20March%2029th%20in%20Cardiff.%20You%20should%20check%20it%20out!%0Abattleofthebeards.eventbrite.co.uk&#8221;\]
