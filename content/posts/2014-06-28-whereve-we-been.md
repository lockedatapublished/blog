Almost into July and I haven&#8217;t posted a single thing in this blog!

Shameful of me to be sure &#8211; I&#8217;ve been learning but not sharing. So what&#8217;s been happening?

Well I moved into a new job at a brand new startup where I&#8217;ve been primarily doing R, modelling, and finally getting my hands back into SQL Server! That&#8217;s been keeping my day&#8217;s and parts of my nights busy. I&#8217;m also working on a startup at home with Oz called <a title="Clocksmith Games" href="http://clocksmithgames.com" target="_blank">Clocksmith Games</a>. On top of that, this year I&#8217;m Chairing <a title="SQLRelayu 2014 - Unlocking Insights from any data!" href="http://sqlrelay.co.uk" target="_blank">SQLRelay </a>&#8211; this means that I&#8217;m currently working with a bunch of awesome people and companies to deliver 8 multi-track conferences in October!

It&#8217;s great being busy but it&#8217;s left me with little time to do the cool stuff like blog about useful stuff. I&#8217;m going to make my H2 priority writing more posts.
