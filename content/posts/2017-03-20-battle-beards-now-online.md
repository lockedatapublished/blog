A fortnight ago I wrote&nbsp;[Dear South Wales & Bristol readers: I need your help][1]&nbsp;as Battle of the Beards was failing. Well, we didn&#8217;t manage to make it to the minimum amount of attendees to go forward with it and on Thursday it looked like I was going to have to cancel it.

Then inspiration struck &#8230; the major reasons why maybe people didn&#8217;t want to attend are:

  1. Too far to travel
  2. Hard to get a day off work
  3. Not interested in all the talks

What would make it so people didn&#8217;t have to travel, could watch from work, and see only the sessions they&#8217;re interested in? Making it an online conference!

The people who have already bought tickets will still be able to have a mini-conference as [CPS Group][2] will kindly host us for the day. Some speakers will be on site, others will be presenting remotely, and now anyone can buy a ticket to watch the talks during the day.

So if you want to catch some awesome speakers and raise some money to fight male suicide, you can grab a ticket now.
