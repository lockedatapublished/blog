Yesterday I had the pleasure of hanging out &#8220;on air&#8221; with [Boris Hristov][1].

We talked open sourcing!
  


You can download and/or contribute to the following projects I have going:

  * [MeDriAnchor][2]: the Metadata Driven Anchor model system. You get to have a lot of fun with 6NF!
  * [optiRum][3]: a useful package for R, especially for the UK
  * [tfsR][4]: for my own special brand of crazy, working with TFS git repositories in R

[James Skipwith][5] (the other major developer on MeDriAnchor) presented on automation and covers MeDriAnchor &#8211; you can check it out at [SQLBits.com][6]

If you&#8217;d like to discuss the vagaries of open sourcing a piece of work, you can use the comments below, my [Contact][7] page, or [tweet me][8]!
