Last year I spoke at 10&nbsp;different events (I think) and was very lucky to be nominated in the Tribal Awards for my Intro to R session. I did just a couple of different session titles and I don&#8217;t think I managed the whole process very well.

To be an easier speaker to deal with, I&#8217;m trying to be more organised so that the selection process of myself & topics is easier whilst also ensuring I don&#8217;t develop too many presentations at the last minute.

Having dealt with awesome serial speakers, <a href="http://koprowskit.eu/geek/" target="_blank">Tobiasz Koprowski</a> and <a href="http://dcac.co/" target="_blank">Denny Cherry</a>, from the organiser end they did a few things which made it much easier to deal with them, particularly given the breadth of topics they can cover!

## Tobiasz

Tobiasz had a spreadsheet that contained session info:

  * Title
  * Abstract
  * Level
  * Contains real examples or demos
  * Track
  * Whether it could be a session and/or a pre-con event

### Pros

  * **Spell checking** &#8211; so long as you know can spell check or hit F7 in Excel, you can check to make sure your abstracts have correct spellings
  * **Filterable** &#8211; as an organiser you might be looking for criteria less about specific session content and more about fit in terms of levels and tracks. Having a spreadsheet enables easy filtering on such criteria to assist with decision making

### Cons

  * **Abstract variations** &#8211; different conferences want different length variants and it would make the spreadsheet very wide to add all of these as columns, degrading readability
  * **Text formatting and encoding** &#8211; a persistent issue for event organisers is formatting of abstracts and bios due to myriad copy and pastes. The use of Excel means that there is a whole raft of formatting to start with before the transformations start

## Denny

Denny had a .txt file for each session abstract.

### Pros

  * **Clarity** &#8211; no risk of faff as it&#8217;s just plain text and no risk of confusion due to applied filters or other issues (it happens to the best of us!)
  * **No text formatting or encoding** &#8211; whether it&#8217;s Denny copying and pasting into a session submission form or an event organiser putting it onto a site or a guidebook, this is going to come through in the destination formatting and provide fewer issues down the line

### Cons

  * **No overview** &#8211; a lack of a spreadsheet / summary document makes it difficult for narrowing down choices based on selection criteria like level and track suitability
  * **No metadata&nbsp;or abstract variants&nbsp;**&#8211; where no info is provided about the session other than the abstract,&nbsp;it makes it difficult to provide all the requisite information that can be required

## Best of both worlds

So looking at their two methods, there&#8217;s some clear things I can do to provide a better experience for myself as form filler and for event organisers than the average speaker.

  * Maintain an easy to peruse summary of all my sessions
  * Keep plain-text files of each session

### My own spin

Of course, just doing what others are doing isn&#8217;t enough for me &#8211; I have to tweak! So the further enhancements are:

  * Metadata in the .txt filenames
  * Consistent layouts that use markdown style minimal formatting
  * Include all necessary metadata like level and session length in the file
  * Use of Notepad++ and then Word to generate abstracts and verify spelling and grammar
  * Bit.ly links to the Dropbox <a href="http://bit.ly/StephsSessions" target="_blank">folder of abstracts</a>, to the <a href="http://bit.ly/sessionroster" target="_blank">session roster</a>, and to <a href="http://bit.ly/StephLocke" target="_blank">my bio </a>to allow easy referencing instead of sending it all via email

## Where next?

It&#8217;s probably not a new system I&#8217;m using and I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s room for improvement. For instance, if I made them more markdown heavy then that&#8217;s great for me as I can use R to knit them together into PDFs, Word docs etc, but not everyone works on markdown (yet!).

In the next blog posts I&#8217;ll cover the topic generation process, and the submission processes I&#8217;m using but for this post I just wanted to cover the management of the session abstracts.

If you&#8217;re an organiser, what are your pet peeves and what could I be doing better?

If you&#8217;re a speaker, what do you do to maintain all your sessions?
