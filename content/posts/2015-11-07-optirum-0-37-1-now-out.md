A while back, I [wrote about how I was waiting][1] to be able to release [optiRum][2] to CRAN, well data.table 1.9.6 was released (a key dependency for new functionality) and I&#8217;ve finally had some quiet time. So optiRum 1.37.1 is now accepted and trickling through the CRAN publish processes.

The package optiRum started out when I worked for [Optimum Credit][3] as a means to give back as we used R a lot. Optimum still use R but for now I&#8217;m still the package maintainer for them.

optiRum has the following key areas of functionality:

  * Financial calcs, like Present Value ([`PV`][4]) 
  * Credit scoring & logistic regressions, like convert from logit to probability ([`logit.prob`][5]) and producing gini charts ([`giniChart`][6])
  * Miscellaneous helper functions, like converting a data.table to XML ([`convertToXML`][7]) and character cleansing for LaTeX tables([`sanitise`][8])

We added functionality for calculating net income in the UK ([`calcNetIncome`][9]). This takes:

  * a data.table of 1 or more people, belonging to 1 or more households (for child tax benefits etc)
  * the level of granularity information is provided at (default is monthly)
  * the year you&#8217;re calculating for
  * any modelling factors you want to trial
  * two data.tables containing general thresholds and tax thresholds

For the most part, only the gross income data.table needs to be provided if you want to do current year modelling. It&#8217;s a fairly complex calculation given all the moving parts and we have checked it against various income calculators but please [file an issue][10] if you find yourself encountering problems or inaccuracies.
