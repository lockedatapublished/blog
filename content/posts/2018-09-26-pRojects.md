So last week saw the end of our ‘Learn to R basics’ series, and I
thought it wise to share with you some things that aren’t code, but
definitely are important before we release you into the wild. So here
are some ways to keep a track of all your hard work, keeping it
organised, well commented, documented and easy to read will honestly
save you hours in the long run!

R Projects and referencing different project directories
========================================================

Setting up a project
====================

When you set up a new project, you’re given three options. This first
section covers the first two…If you’ve cracked those and you’re making
the big jump into repositories the you can skip down to section 3.

Why you should bother
=====================

Setting up a project each time you have a bunch of related work to do
keeps everything in one place, it makes everything really easy to
reference between workbooks and it means you never ever have to do
`setwd()` (which might lead to more than one person threatening to set
your computer alight). This also makes projects much more shareable,
because nothing relates to a specific place on a local disk.
Reproducibility is a **huge** aspect of good, user friendly code.

Github and version control
==========================

I just mentioned sharing and reproducing code for yourself and for
others, so this is where the third option comes in. Using a repository
such as Github keeps your code safe, and it keeps previous versions of
your code safe too - so if (when) you make a big ol’ mess, you can just
revert back to a copy you know works, forget it ever happened and start
over! Let’s look at how you set up a git repo linked to a project.

Git in RStudio
==============

Using git inside RStudio couldn’t be easier. As soon as you open up a
project linked to a git repo, the Git tab will appear on your screen.
From here you can manage, commit, push and pull all your changes without
ever having to go near your terminal, which for some can be a bit of a
daunting prospect - there’s a lot of potential for things to go wrong in
there!! Steer well clear of terminal commands if you’re a newbie,
speaking from experience…you just might get in a bit of a mess! :)

Bet you didn’t think it could get any easier did you? Well would you
believe it could! Staph has super kindly built an entire package just to
make setting up projects even more simple. By using this you’ll never
forget the important elements and you know that by running just one line
of code as I’ve included below, you’ll be set up and ready to go in
literal seconds!

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

devtools::install_github("stephlocke/pRojects") # install the package from github
library(pRojects)
```

``` r
LockeDataBlog <- "testproj" # Swap your project name with LockeDataBlog

createBasicProject(LockeDataBlog, travis = TRUE, packrat = TRUE, git = TRUE, readme = TRUE) # And again here
```

This sets you up with a very basic project directory and now you’re free
to get to work! There’s more helpful stuff in the `pRojects` package,
like functions to set up analysis, package and training projects for
when you’re ready for them, but for now, this basic file structure
should be enough!

Neat coding 101 - referencing various directories in your work
--------------------------------------------------------------

Keep your code clean and tidy by getting used to using these shorthand
references for various directories in your work. If you’re using
projects to organise yourself, inevitably at some point you are going to
want to link back to something. That could be anything from inserting an
image into a markdown document saved in an ‘images’ folder, to loading
in a dataset to conduct some analysis on it, from your ‘data’ folder.
You can use the tab key on your keyboard to help you autocomplete the
file path and avoid errors!

`.` this dir  
`./thisdir` this directory explicitly  
`..` the parent directory to the one you’re in  
`../someotherdir` a directory adjacent to your current one  
`../../somehighleveldir` a directory adjacent to your parent directory

Hopefully you’ve found something in this blog useful, and a handly
follow up if you’ve been working your way through the Learn to R blog
series. Trust me as somebody three years into using R and now writing a
thesis using nothing but…**projects save lifes!!** (and time, and
tears…)

Look out for the next post coming soon on using R to plan an actual
project and generating an interactive gantt chart to keep you
accountable!
