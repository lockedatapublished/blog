I've been pretty quiet on the blog front recently. That's because I overhauled my site, migrating it to [Hugo](//gohugo.io) (the foundation of [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)). Just doing one extra thing on top of my usual workload, I also did another thing. I wrote a book too!

I'm a big book fan, and I'm especially a Kindle Unlimited fan (all the books you can read for Â£8 per month, heck yeah!) so I wanted to make books that I could publish and see on Kindle Unlimited.

Starting with a series of books teaching the R fundamentals, I tentatively plan on releasing a new book every two months until I run out of topics.

Each book will be 3-7 hours of reading and exercises since I also believe in the value of practical activities.

The first book Working with R covers R basics like packages, functions, and basic data manipulation.


It's available on Kindle Unlimited ([sign up for a free trial](http://geni.us/kultd)), Kindle, and paperback. If you buy the paperback, you can currently get the Kindle book for free.

Hopefully the price and level at which the material is pitched will make this a great book to help you learn R or see if R is for you.

Here are some words from the beta-readers about the book:

- Steph's writing has a very lively and engaging style that is a pleasure to read. Working with R is an excellent introduction into an important part of learning Data Science. Read it and enjoy learning.
- I wish this book had been available when I started learning R!
- The fundamentals for R are well explained, made interesting and relevant. This book is worthwhile reference for the novice and provides a quick comprehensive  review for people currently using R.
