[![Organising SQLRelay][1]][2][![Speaking at SQLRelay][3]][2]
  
After dipping Cardiff&#8217;s collective toes into the world of local SQL Server conferences, we&#8217;re doing it again in <a title="Cardiff Agenda" href="http://www.sqlrelay.co.uk/" target="_blank">November</a>.  We&#8217;re taking registrations, and volunteers are always welcome.  If an all day conference is a bit too much, why not try out a lunchtime or evening <a title="CSSUG" href="http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-SQL-Server-User-Group/" target="_blank">event</a>?

There are <a title="SQLRelay" href="http://www.sqlrelay.co.uk" target="_blank">9 other events</a> around the country which you can attend as well as / instead of Cardiff, including Bristol where I&#8217;ve the privilege of speaking along with some excellent folk like <a title="SQLPassion" href="http://www.sqlpassion.at/blog/" target="_blank">Klaus Aschenbrenner</a>.

These are awesome events which people have worked hard to deliver for FREE, whilst having world-renowned speakers delivering top notch content, so whether you attend or not, please spread the word and encourage people to take their learning and personal development into their own hands.
