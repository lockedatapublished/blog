Logistic regressions are a great tool for predicting outcomes that are categorical. They use a transformation function based on probability to perform a linear regression. This makes them easy to interpret and implement in other systems.

Logistic regressions can be used to perform a classification for things like determining whether someone needs to go for a biopsy. They can also be used for a more nuanced view by using the probabilities of an outcome for thinks like prioritising interventions based on likelihood to default on a loan.

I recently did a remote talk to Plymouth University on logistic regressions, which covers:

  * how they work (not maths heavy!)
  * how you build them in R
  * things to think about when preparing you data
  * ways to evaluate a logistic regression

You can watch the [video][1] below, get the [slides][2], and view the slides&#8217; [source code][3].

This talk is a cut-down version of my [community workshop][4] on logistic regressions, which is in itself a cut-down version of a full day of training on them. [Get in touch][5] if you&#8217;re interested in the talk or workshop for your user group, or if you&#8217;d like to discuss in-depth training.
