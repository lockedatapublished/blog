For my <a href="http://sqlsatexeter.azurewebsites.net/?page_id=342" title="SQLSaturday Exeter pre-con Apr 24th - Steph Locke" target="_blank">precon on R</a> at the end of the month I&#8217;m working on the takeaway &#8212; the handout. This&#8217;ll be thing that makes the training day able to be put into practice immediately, and refills all those drink and sleep depleted neurons back up with R knowledge.

One of the things is a simple <a href="https://github.com/stephlocke/Rtraining/blob/master/inst/handouts/fundamentals/tablewrangling.Rmd" title="Data.table cookbook" target="_blank">data.table cookbook</a>. If you&#8217;re a data.table user, what other tasks do you think should be on there? _You can comment here, on the code, or even make suggestions and submitting them with a pull request_
