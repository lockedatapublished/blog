I talked back in November about the [idea of an RSaturday][1], which were free community-driven conferences on R. Since then, we created a [GitHub repository][2] and started hammering out the details for satRdays. The current proposal consists of:

  1. A name: satRday
  2. A proposition: Free/cheap (<Â£30) conferences organised by user groups around the world. Attendees get more access to training in R, with a much lower cost-barrier. We develop more speakers on R. Organisers have less work to do and get to develop their R community.
  3. A platform: Using the Drupal COD system, we can use an open source solution and contribute back to it
  4. A proposal for the R consortium: A request for hosting plus support for the first three trial conferences

We&#8217;ll be submitting the proposal before the deadline (Jan 10th) but we need people to register their interest in being involved, whether that&#8217;s simply attending or going as far as organising one.

**So folks, please [register your interest][3] and get others to do it too!**
