I&#8217;ve got slots in there for full hour sessions as well as lightning talks for up to half an hour long so whether you&#8217;re an existing&nbsp;speaker or&nbsp;[want to improve your knowledge][1], please [get in touch][2] and book yourself in.<!--more-->

## Lunches

Our lunch time sessions where the user group teaches the user group have been going fantastically.

At the moment, the weekly change in topic is being retained so that we cover:

  1. Development
  2. Business Intelligence
  3. Database Administration
  4. SQL language fundamentals

With attendance varying from 5 to 15 people, these are shorter and more informal sessions that provide a fantastic opportunity to&nbsp;focus your knowledge on a topic and help your current and future colleagues. Each person who delivers a session will get a 1-month free <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a> subscription so that by giving you get a lot back. One of our members is using the language fundamentals as verification for his Microsoft certification&nbsp;and reason to keep studying, which is really helping him out.

If you want to talk at one of lunch events &#8211; again let me know!

## SQLRelay

Organisation of SQLRelay should be kicking off in the next few weeks and hopefully we&#8217;ll be throwing an event&nbsp;in Cardiff again. To keep up to date with what&#8217;s happening, follow <a href="http://twitter.com/sqlrelay_uk" target="_blank">@SQLRelay_uk</a>
