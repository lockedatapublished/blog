OK, if you haven&#8217;t heard of it before [Slack][1] is kinda like IRC, kinda like Dropbox, kinda like a lot of things &#8211; it&#8217;s a neat place to bring together communications between your team or community, and the integrations allow you to pipe in external feeds like twitter activity or RSS. It&#8217;s a great way of collaborating online and I&#8217;ve found it especially useful not just within a company but within a global community.

I belong to a number of Slack groups which some of you may be interested in joining:

  * [SQL Server Community][2] is all about the Microsoft Data Platform and [dog pics][3] (that may just be me ðŸ˜‰ )
  * [satRdays][4] for talking about satRdays including developing the site, events, etc
  * [Rest Azured][5] is for talking Azure and is primarily a troubleshooting community with a bunch of active Azure MVPs helping out
  * [Cardiff Dev][6] for talking tech and having a laugh, aimed at local Cardiff techies
  * [Confhouse][7] for discussing events you&#8217;re organising and getting advice off fellow organisers

These are just a selection of the groups I&#8217;m involved in and it&#8217;s been extremely helpful extending my network outside of twitter in a more collaborative format. There are lots of community slack groups out there and I recommend you give Slack a go by finding some groups that fit your interests. If one of the above isn&#8217;t your jam, there a number of Slack directories out there, but my current favourite is [Slofile][8]. If like me you have a lot of Slack teams you belong to then I recommend you start using [Franz][9], which if nothing else arrays Slack channels horizontally which works extremely well on my XPS13&#8217;s aspect ratio.

Have fun Slacking folks!

_PS Any Slack communities you&#8217;d recommend for me to join?_
