**UPDATE: R 3.4.1 does not have this problem so you can install that version instead**
  
If you&#8217;re getting the following error when you&#8217;ve installed R 3.4.0 on Windows, you&#8217;re not alone.

> Error in if (file.exists(dest) && file.mtime(dest) > file.mtime(lib) && :
     
> missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed 

The R team have released a patched version but right now it&#8217;s a little difficult to find out about. If you need/want the patched version, it&#8217;s available at:

[cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rpatched.html][1]

This resolved the issue for me.

If you want more info on the issue and the resolution process, check out the [r-help archive][2].

Hope this helps!
