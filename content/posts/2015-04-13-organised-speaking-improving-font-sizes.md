A recurring problem with my presentations is font size.

  * The inclusion of code in my Rmarkdown slides was by default too small. Upping the fontsize via CSS worked ok, but when I switched to a shiny app version for my intro to shiny, it reverted and I&#8217;m afraid to say I didn&#8217;t notice beforehand.
  * I use PuTTY for showing how to do some stuff in the linux command line but the font&#8217;s quite small by default and Gail Shaw&#8217;s tip of Magnifier in my session was tough to use
  * I&#8217;ve upped my font size on my Rstudio IDE, but hadn&#8217;t yet implemented this across other IDEs
  * I tend to use my mouse cursor to draw attention to things. A whirring small white cursor isn&#8217;t exactly noticeable.

So, I&#8217;m taking steps to correct and make my presentations easier for my audience. _You may already know some or all of these and if there&#8217;s better way, do suggest it!_

  * Visual Studio: Using the PresentOn (by typing PresentOn into the Search bar) functionality from the <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/dbcb8670-889e-4a54-a226-a48a15e4cace" title="Productivity Power Tools 2013 " target="_blank">Productivity Power Tools</a> extension, to make **all** the fonts bigger in Visual Studio
  * PuTTY: Using this <a href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/07/10-practical-putty-tips-and-tricks-you-probably-didnt-know/" title="PuTTY tips and tricks" target="_blank">tips & tricks page</a> I realised there are font options so now size 20 font is the default for presenting! w00t
  * Slides: Gathering all the code block CSS options from shiny, ioslides, and slidy and adding as a single CSS I can drop into any of these presentations
  * Cursor wiggling: I&#8217;ve upgraded my clicking finger to a presenting clicker and bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-910-001352-R800-Professional-Presenter/dp/B002L3TSLG" title="Logitech r800 on amazon" target="_blank">Logitech R800</a> based on people&#8217;s recommendations. This has a snazzy green laser which I can use. 

It&#8217;s worth noting as well, that I also completely forgot I had ZoomIt installed but it should be very helpful, especially with the advice in this <a href="http://regularitguy.com/2012/11/30/how-to-deliver-impactful-demos-part-2-zoomit-or-loose-it/" title="ZoomIt blog post" target="_blank">ZoomIt or lose it post</a>.
