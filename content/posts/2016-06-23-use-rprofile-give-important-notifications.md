In R, we can use a file called .Rprofile to do things in R based on a number of triggers. One thing I&#8217;ve done is give myself a DIY notification of how many data breaches I&#8217;ve been involved in!

First of all, you need a file called .Rprofile that&#8217;s stored in your working directory. Some useful resources about .Rprofiles can be found on [.Rprofile CRAN docs][1] and [an .Rprofile intro][2].

Now inside that file, you can add a number of functions that are based on a number of events like loading or closing R. I need a `.First` function for on load and whatever I produce has to be able to print to the console with `cat()`.

With that in mind, instead of showing details, I chose to show the number of breaches I&#8217;m in. You can get [HIBPwned][3] from CRAN and use it to query the awesome website [HaveIBeenPwned.com][4].

One thing that&#8217;s neat about the `account_breach()` function is that I can query multiple email addresses or user formats to get info. Here is my .Rprofile file that gives me notifications on load for data breaches:
