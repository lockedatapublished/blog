Are you looking for gift ideas for the R addicts in your life or the next guest speaker at your user group? Here are a few ideas, in four categories! Not all of them feature our company, promised. ;-)

# Learning and using R

Is your dear one just starting to learn R? You might help them by gifting them a book, or even a couple of them! We suggest the R fundamentals series by Locke Data's Steph Locke, [Volume 1, Working with R](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1999842618/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i2) and [Volume 2, Data Manipulation in R](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1979699933/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1), both of them available as paperback and Kindle versions. Other useful books for R users of all levels include [R books by O'Reilly](http://bestprogrammingbooks.com/9-r-popular-o-reilly-books/).

If the R user in your life uses RStudio packages, they might appreciate using [RStudio cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheat sheets/) about data manipulation, dates and times, Keras, etc. The cheatsheets are available for free, and you could print and laminate a few of them as a gift!

# Becoming a legit package developer

Is the person you want to surprise a package developer? How about increasing their confidence and joy in their package by gifting them a voucher for a hex logo creation by [Locke Creatives](https://twitter.com/LockeCreatives)? Oz Locke, who has designed the hex logos for RDogLadies, [`visdat`](https://github.com/ropensci/visdat#visdat-) and [`naniar`](https://github.com/njtierney/naniar#naniar-), among others. Reach out to Oz on Twitter if you'd like to know more!

As a complement, you could then offer to print the created hex logos as stickers.

# Decorating one's office

Why not gift R art to hang on the walls? We like

* Drawings by the very talented Allison Horst, that you could have print and have framed. She does not seem to have a shop yet, but you could contact her!

- This nifty [`magrittr` cross-stich found on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/fr/listing/554706505/ceci-nest-pas-une-pipe-au-point-de-croix )!

# Getting out of one's office

Loving R does not mean working at one's desk all the time. 

- The R community likes hex shaped things. You could gift a hex shaped baking tin, or other hex shaped objects, with material to personalize them, or you could personalize them yourself. E.g. see these gorgeous coasters!

- Have you heard of the SatRday conferences? They're community-lead, low-cost one day R conferences. You could buy a ticket to your dear one's local satRday conference, or even make a trip out of it if the conference is not that local. Check out [SatRdays calendar](https://satrdays.org/events/). There's one planned in [Paris](https://paris2019.satrdays.org/) on February the 23d!

That's it! It might be a little bit late for the holidays depending on the ones you celebrate, but occasions to give presents will surely happen again soon! Please share your other gift ideas for R lovers in the comments!
