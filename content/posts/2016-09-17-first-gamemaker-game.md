Getting started with GameMaker, making Asteroids! I mean OK, it&#8217;s just a clone of a classic, but isn&#8217;t that how fledgling artists practice? Initially created following [a tutorial][1], I then went through and added a lot of extra features, including music, splash screens, a pause function and much cleaner code.

Embedding by i-frame is pretty ugly, so please follow the link below to try the game.

[Asteroids Game][2]

<pre>A/D or Left/Right to turn
W or Up to move
Space or Right Control to shoot
Escape to pause</pre>

You can download the gmz file, and import into your copy of Game Maker if you&#8217;d like, using this link: <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/40423572/Asteroids.gmz>
