# How to use an R interface with an Airtable API
-------------------------------------------------
Hi folks, so this blog is about how to use an R interface with an Airtable API. 
We are going to be using this interface and API to pick our winner for our [T-shirt draw](https://twitter.com/LockeData/status/997170312323055616). We will also be using the dplyr function `sample_n()`.
There are a couple of different R packages that you can use but i used [Darko Bergant's package](https://github.com/bergant/airtabler).You'll also need to use `devtools`.

# Set up
--------
To install `devtools` all you need to do is `install.packages("devtools")`.

Now you need to install [Darko Bergant's package](https://github.com/bergant/airtabler).
`devtools::install_github("bergant/airtabler")`

Next you need to generate the airtable API key from your [Airtable account](https://airtable.com/account) page.

# Library
----------
Now that you have `devtools` and [bergant/airtabler](https://github.com/bergant/airtabler) installed you need load them into the session to be used.
```library(airtabler)
library(dplyr)```

# Retrieve the data as a data.frame
-----------------------------------
To retrieve the data as a `data.frame` you'll need your [Airtable API key]((https://airtable.com/account).
```Sys.setenv("AIRTABLE_API_KEY"="<Your API key") #example key************** ```
Then you need to add the base that you want to pull the data from.
```airtable <- airtabler::airtable("<base key>", "<Tab/sheet name>")
airtable <- airtable$`<Tab/sheet name>`$select_all()```

In your enviroment you should now see in data:
airtable x obs. of x variable. You can click to the right of that to open the table if you want. 

# Using the dplyr function `sample_n()`
---------------------------------------
Finally we have all the data we need in a `data.frame` we can now use the dplyr function. We just want to pick one row to be our winner.
```sample_n(airtable, 1) #1 is the number of rows we want```

This is our result.

(Note i used myself here as the example)

# Other bits you can do
-----------------------
If you don't want to select some random data here are a few other things you can do.
If you type
```airtable$`<your tab/sheet>` ```
You can get a list of functions available for you to play with 
```$list_records
function (offset = NULL, recursive = TRUE, filter_by_formula = NULL) 
{
    list_records(air_options, table, offset, recursive, filter_by_formula)
}
environment: ***********

$retrieve_record
function (record_id) 
{
    retrieve_record(air_options, table, record_id)
}
environment: ***********

$create_record
function (fields) 
{
    create_record(air_options, table, fields)
}
environment: ***********

$update_record
function (record_id, fields, method = "PATCH") 
{
    update_record(air_options, table, record_id, fields, method = method)
}
environment: ***********

$delete_record
function (record_id) 
{
    delete_record(air_options, table, record_id)
}
environment: *********** ```
