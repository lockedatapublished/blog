**Why do I use <a title="Dynamic named ranges â€“ the basics" href="https://itsalocke.com/index.php/dynamic-named-ranges-the-basics/" target="_blank">dynamic named ranges</a>?**

Where I work, most reports are exposed via a web front-end and Excel can create an external connection and retrieve the information.&nbsp; This is much safer than using direct database connections in workbooks.&nbsp; A problem with web queries though is that they cannot be converted to Tables in order for referencing columns and the dataset as a whole to be made easier.&nbsp; As a result, dynamic named ranges are a necessity for producing easy to develop and manage spreadsheets since the volumes in the raw data can change over time.

**How I save myself time**

A raw data table with 20 columns will take a long time to create the named ranges for, given that I want:

  1. A dynamic range covering the headers too for pivot tables
  2. A dynamic range without headers for vlookups
  3. A dynamic range for each column without headers

I use a macro, assigned to a nice button on my ribbon, to generate all the relevant ranges.

**What are the special considerations?**

Structure &#8211; raw data tables should ALWAYS be set up in a specific way &#8211; with the Primary Key on the left hand side and always filled in, with no empty rows or columns

Special characters &#8211; range names can&#8217;t contain special characters.&nbsp; The VBA uses the <a title="RegEx functions in VBA" href="https://itsalocke.com/index.php/regex-functions-in-vba/" target="_blank">RegEx</a> functionality to strip these out.

Numbers &#8211; range names can&#8217;t have numbers either.&nbsp; We can&#8217;t just strip out the numbers like we would special characters because they might be important like Grade1, Grade2 and Grade3 and collapsing them all to the name Grade would be a problem.&nbsp; Instead, the macro converts all numbers to the corresponding letter in the alphabet.

How much the data will grow?&nbsp; By default I set the macro to use 10 times the number of records present when I run the macro &#8211; if it&#8217;s already bigger than 25k rows, the number will need to be reduced, and if I don&#8217;t think 10 times the number will be adequate, I&#8217;ll increase the number.

**What&#8217;s the code then?**
