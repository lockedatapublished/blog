Sponsoring community events &#8211; is it right for you? This series of posts will take you through the things you need to know to help you decide.

Over the coming weeks, this new series will go through the in&#8217;s and out&#8217;s of sponsoring community events. Community events are fantastic from an attendee perspective, but when you&#8217;re handing over cash you need to know what you&#8217;re letting yourself in for and how you get return on investment (ROI). This series will address how you find opportunities, what&#8217;s involved, how you can assess an opportunity, what ROI metrics you can track, and so on.

The motivation for these posts is my work on sponsorship for [SQL Relay][1]. It&#8217;s something I really enjoy as it gives me insight into so many businesses, and it gives me a lot of empathy for marketing departments, sales teams, and those founders still doing everything! I&#8217;ve seen phenomenal returns and dismal failures. I wanted to write something that helps both technical and non-technical people alike get a better grasp on community events from a sponsorship perspective.

The series of posts will cover:

  * [The basics of sponsorship][2]
  * [How to assess a potential sponsorship opportunity][3]
  * [Managing sponsorship of an event][4]
  * [Managing on-site engagements][5]
  * How to assess the impact of sponsoring an event
  * Managing a portfolio of sponsored events
