[Data Manipulation in R](http://geni.us/datamanipulationinr) is now generally available on Amazon.

[Data Manipulation in R](http://geni.us/datamanipulationinr) is the second book in my [R Fundamentals series](http://geni.us/rfundamentals) that takes folks from no programming knowledge through to an experienced R user. [Working with R](http://geni.us/workingwithr) focussed on the very basics and this second book covers data wrangling.

Introducing the core skill of working with tabular data, this book goes from importing data, to analysing it, and then getting it back out for consumption elsewhere. Leaning heavily on the tidyverse, I think it's an accessible introduction for those new to analysing data.

## What's next
The next book in the series is on data visualisation. It'll obviously include `ggplot2` and `leaflet` but I'd like to hear from youu about the data viz packages you wish had been around when you were getting into R.

## What's covered
Working in the tidyverse universe, I show folks how to analyse data using a rough framework. 

- Getting data with R
- Data pipelines
- Filtering columns
- Filtering rows
- Working with names
- Rearranging your data
- Changing your data
- Working with dates
- Working with text
- Summarising data
- Combining datasets
- Reshaping data
- Getting data out of R
- Putting it all together

I step by step through it and then spend a chapter putting it all together.

## Awesome graphics
A great reason to get the colour copy of the book is to see Lise Vaudor's amazing graphics. Check out the initial blog posts at  [perso.ens-lyon.fr/lise.vaudor](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/lise.vaudor/).
