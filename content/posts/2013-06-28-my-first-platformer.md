# My Platformer



Here&#8217;s my first attempt at a platformer, built in Construct 2 and using sprites form Game Maker.

<span style="color: #99cc00;"><!--more--></span>





It took me a about a week and it&#8217;s very simple but I&#8217;ve already hit the limit for events in the free version of Construct2! I guess I&#8217;m going to have buy a personal license.

There are several tweeks I want to make to it, like a tracked best time, but I&#8217;ll do that later.
