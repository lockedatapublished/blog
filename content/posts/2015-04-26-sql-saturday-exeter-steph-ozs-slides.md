Well [SQL Saturday Exeter][1] flew by. T&#8217;was great catching up with people, seeing folks learn how to use (old & new) tools better, and just generally watching everyone having a great time at one of the best organised conferences I have the pleasure of going to.

Here are links to all the slide decks etc that we presented this weekend:

  * My [R: analysis to integration training day notes][2] & [source code][3] 
  * My [agile BI slide deck][4]
  * My Shiny: dashboards in R [slide deck][5] & [source code][6]
  * Oz&#8217;s [SSRS: Beyond the basics slide deck & source code][7]

If you attended any of our sessions, [give us some constructive criticism][8]!
