In May, I will be delivering two R for Microsoft training days. These two days will focus on some R fundamentals and applying these fundamentals within the Microsoft Data Platform. These training days are ideal if you know one half of the components &#8211; whether that&#8217;s the R bit or the Microsoft BI bit. Either way, you&#8217;ll learn about the other half.

## SQLBits

[SQLBits][1] XV is being held in Liverpool this year and my training day is on May 4th. I&#8217;ll be co-training with the indefatigable, Andrew Fryer aka [@Deepfat][2] from Microsoft.

You can check out our awful promo video or go [read the abstract and find out more info][3]

SQLBits is a fantastic conference filled to the brim with great people, great content, and great parties. I highly recommend you come along if you use SQL Server, are looking to improve how you handle databases as a developer, or you&#8217;re looking to boost your BI or analytical skills.

## TUGA IT

[TUGA IT][4] is being held in Lisbon, Portugal between the 19th and 21st of May. I&#8217;ll be delivering pretty much the same training day as SQLBits but it has the added benefit of being in lovely Portugal!

[Niko][6] & co host excellent conferences and of course it&#8217;s in Portugal, so if you&#8217;d like to travel for a holiday and spend a couple of days learning whilst you&#8217;re at it, then TUGA is ideal.
