I had the pleasure of presenting at [unified.diff][1], a general programming user group in Cardiff, last night and was able to debut my LaTeX show!

_If you&#8217;d like to talk at the group about anything tech related tweet them on [@unifiedDiff][2]. They&#8217;re very flexible on time and topic so if you&#8217;re based in Cardiff or are coming down to see a client, it&#8217;s an easy way of delivering a talk and meeting some nice people._

## Source control smells

This was an interesting talk by Gavin Davies ([@GavD_UK][3]).

I&#8217;ve been struggling with some of these recently so it was good to hear that I&#8217;m neither alone nor totally screwed up in how I&#8217;ve been using git this past year.

One of the things that came out of the talk, was that there&#8217;s no easy over-arching repo management tool that helps fix these. There are articles out there on how to do them but it&#8217;s inevitably a complex task &#8211; so if you&#8217;re looking for an open source project, consider the idea delivered!

The repo smells were:

  1. Feature Envy &#8211; checking out entire repo for one small module
  2. Too many eggs in one basket &#8211; bundled tools but non-related change cycles
  3. Permissions minefield &#8211; different permissions within a repo
  4. IP dispersal &#8211; many repos but heavily related
  5. High correlation in changes &#8211; related change cycles

## The LaTeX show

My presentation on LaTeX can be consumed in a number of formats:

  1. Download the slides: [Dropbox][5]
  2. Clone the repo: https://www.overleaf.com/2552616xcdftt 
      * Read the code: [Overleaf][6]</ol>
