# My Day/Night Cycle



Here&#8217;s my Day/Night cycle function demo, built in Construct 2. (Time moving at 4 minutes per second)





It took me a day and a half of hair pulling, but I&#8217;ve only been using Construct 2 for a week so I suppose it&#8217;s not too shabby. It uses only 6 events, 2 global variables and 9 objects.
