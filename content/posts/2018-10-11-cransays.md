We at [Locke Data](https://github.com/lockedata) maintain a few R packages that we've submitted to CRAN to help increase their userbase. After running `devtools::release()`, clicking in a confirmation email... what remains is _waiting_. Inspired by our experience, we've created a dashboard to help other package maintainers follow their package's journey to CRANterbury. Read more about its making in this post!

# Why create the cransays dashboard?

Sometimes, depending on the workload of CRAN volunteers, it can last a while before a package ends up on their way to CRAN. The number of submissions has increased a lot within the last few years! As per [CRAN policies](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html#Submission), "You can check that the submission was received by looking at ftp://CRAN.R-project.org/incoming/.". The content of that ftp server is divided into various subfolders, making the research of one's package pretty tricky.

After having to do that a few days in a row for checking on one of our submissions, we decided a dashboard showing all packages and their submission stage in one go would be quite useful, so we made it happen!

# How we made the cransays dashboard?

In this section you'll discover how we create a snapshot of the CRAN incoming state, format it, and then deploy it to the interwebs every hour!

## Creating a snapshot of CRAN incoming

First of all, we wrote a function `take_snapshot()` to create a snapshot of the ftp server. Technically, we query the different ftp folders using `curl` and `utils::read.delim()`, munging strings and datetimes along the way. Our original code was adapted from [an insightful repo by Edgar Ruiz at RStudio](https://github.com/edgararuiz/cran-stages/), that is a good read about the different stages of submission.

The `take_snapshot()` function was improved thanks to the contributions of [Mitchell O'Hara-Wild](https://mitchelloharawild.com/) and [Hugo Gruson](https://www.normalesup.org/~hgruson/). Receiving PRs so rapidly after opening [hacktoberfest issues](https://itsalocke.com/blog/up-your-open-source-game-with-hacktoberfest-at-locke-data/) was really appreciated!

## Presenting the snapshot

Then, the dashboard itself is the `data.frame` returned by `take_snapshot()` formatted by the `DT` package. The formatting of that `datatable` was improved thanks to external contributions again! Thank you, [Hugo Gruson](https://www.normalesup.org/~hgruson/) and [Jim Hester](https://www.jimhester.com)!


## Packaging it all together

Find the source for our dashboard [here](https://github.com/lockedata/cransays). `cransays` is structured as a package, because

* Packages are cool, duh!

* It helps with managing dependencies thanks to DESCRIPTION.

* It allowed us to rip off the benefits of [`pkgdown`](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown) and [`travis`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/travis) + [`tic`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/tic). We wrote the `DT` code inside a vignette -- [`usethis::use_vignette()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_vignette.html) for the win. Then, with the two lines below, we were able to deploy a website for the package from Travis! Every push to the master branch of our repo meant `pkgdown::build_site()` is run on Travis and the result is pushed to a gh-pages branch!

```r
# install.packages("usethis")
# remotes::install_github("ropenscilabs/tic")

usethis::use_pkgdown() # creates the pkgdown config file
travis::use_tic() # creates boilerplate deploy code, lets you browse GitHub and Travis to create tokens.


```

We added a few lines to and [_pkgdown.yml](https://github.com/lockedata/cransays/blob/master/_pkgdown.yml#L2) and [travis.yml](https://github.com/lockedata/cransays/blob/master/.travis.yml#L6) to be able to use [our own `pkgdown` style](https://github.com/lockedatapublished/lockedatapkg). Steph wrote [posts about deploying docs from Travis in case you want to know more about the process](https://itsalocke.com/blog/automated-documentation-hosting-on-github-via-travis-ci/) but when using rOpenSci's packages `tic` and `travis`, you don't even need to think about it much.

Thanks to this `pkgdown`-Travis setup, you can find our dashboard [here](https://cransays.itsalocke.com/articles/dashboard.html) with [a homepage with more information](https://cransays.itsalocke.com/index.html).

## Updating it regularly!

Steph took care of the deploy via Netlify to a subdomain of itsalocke.com, otherwise we could have used the GitHub pages hosting from the gh-pages branch. Steph also created a Zapier zap so that there'd be a Travis build triggered every hour. It means that our dashboard is updated at least every hour, which seemed [_lagom_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom).

# Sit back and enjoy, or improve the project?

Now, we're able to follow our submissions using our nifty dashboard, and you can do that too! We've also been thinking about: 

* getting metadata about each submission by unpacking them and using the [`desc` package](https://github.com/r-lib/desc) and [`pkgload::parse_ns_file()`](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgload),

* and saving the snapshots over time, very similar to [what the RStudio folks did in the spring](https://github.com/edgararuiz/cran-stages/). 

Stay tuned via [`cransays`' issue tracker](https://github.com/lockedata/cransays/issues)! In the meantime, happy R package development, and good luck with your CRAN submissions!
