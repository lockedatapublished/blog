Since August, I&#8217;ve had the pleasure to work at [Mango Solutions][1], a data science consultancy, as a Principal Consultant.

In that time, I&#8217;ve been to [EARL London][2], [SQL Relay][3], and [SQL in the City][4], so conference season has been in full swing with more to come in the form [EARL Boston][5] next week. Surprisingly, I&#8217;ve also found some time to help some customers out **and** write some blog posts over on the Mango site.

I thought I&#8217;d share them for the folks who might have missed out on them.

  * [10 top tips for being a better coder][6]
  * [Mango at SQL Relay][7]
  * [My RBelgium presentation][8] 

There&#8217;s more to come with one coming out early next week and you can subscribe via the [RSS feed][9], or if you&#8217;d like to get even more R goodness, subscribe to [R-bloggers][10]. Over the next couple of months, I&#8217;m looking to get started on some new open source projects. One idea raised is to give [@MangoTheCat][11] its own [LOLCODE][12] to R interpreter so if you want to lend a hand in making such a thing, let me know!

KTHXBYE
