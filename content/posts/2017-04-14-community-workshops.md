Following on from when we [announced the availability][1] of our community workshops, we&#8217;ve got three in the next three months that folks can attend.

## May 19th &#8211; Data science project in a day

We&#8217;ll be in Kiev, Ukraine, doing a whole data science project in a day. This is intended to give people a little bit of code, process, and critical thinking along the whole data science workflow. This will enable folks to see how it hangs together and decide where and how much they want to invest their learning in future.

Tickets for this workshop are currently ~£60 so even if people flew over and stayed a couple of nights, it&#8217;d still be pretty darn cheap!

## June 26th &#8211; Introduction to R

We&#8217;ll be in Newcastle, UK, doing an introduction to R. This focuses on data analysis skills, working with databases, and writing reusable code. It&#8217;s also split into two halves so folks can come along for only half the day.

Tickets for this workshop are £50 for a half day or £90 for the whole day, with discounts available to certain groups.
