Not quite part of being organised at speaking, but bundled up in part of my scheduling constraints for speaking is when I&#8217;m throwing user group events. Here&#8217;s the details of the user groups I&#8217;m planning on throwing to meet my goal of 1 user group event a month (not including lunch time sessions!)

### SQL Server

I run the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-SQL-Server-User-Group/" title="SQLCardiff" target="_blank">SQL Server user group</a> in Cardiff and have done a few years &#8211; I&#8217;m not giving it up any time soon. We&#8217;re currently at a bi-monthly event and a weekly lunchtime event. As it&#8217;s only happening every other month, I&#8217;ve got a slot for a bi-monthly meeting of some other sort of user group.

### R

I&#8217;ve been using R for two years now and it&#8217;s truly a fantastic language once you&#8217;re over the initial learning curve. There is/was an R user group run within Cardiff Uni but it happened infrequently and during the day. This isn&#8217;t enough for me, particularly given the breadth of topics that can be covered so I&#8217;ve kicked off an <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/" title="Cardiff R UG" target="_blank">R user group</a>.

The plan will be to run evening talks in the months between the SQL Server events, meeting the Throw 1 part of my goal, and of course get some lunch time workshops going if possible.

I&#8217;ve put more detail about the R user group in the post <a href="https://itsalocke.com/index.php/starting-the-cardiff-r-user-group/" title="Starting the Cardiff R User Group" target="_blank">Starting the Cardiff R User Group</a>.

### .Net

I recently <a href="http://strawpoll.me/3108093/r" title="Poll results" target="_blank">polled</a> folks about what user groups they&#8217;d most like to see and the results were overwhelmingly in the favour of a .Net UG. I don&#8217;t do anything with .Net &#8211; I can&#8217;t even deploy a Lightswitch app!
