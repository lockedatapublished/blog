Another quick post off the back of a SQL Lunch a did a while ago. Explore it via SQLFiddle: <http://sqlfiddle.com/#!6/ad7f5/7/0>

##  What is a CTE?

A Common Table Expression (CTE) is essentially a function defining a relation instead of a table.
  
This function outputs a table (like all queries) that is only present within the session, but data isn&#8217;t stored in tempdb like with a temporary table.

## Why CTE&#8217;s?

CTEs are designed _primarily_ to allow recursion within SQL &#8211; like a loop but ideal at working with hierarchies. This is excellent for tables that are self-referential &#8230; think employees!

Additionally, they&#8217;re great for generating sequences&#8230; think times, dates, etc

## What&#8217;s the syntax?

<pre>WITH [Tbl Name] ([col],[names],..) AS
 (
 SQL
 )</pre>

Produce multiple CTEs by comma separating them

<pre>WITH
 [Tbl Name] ([col],[names],..) AS
 ( SQL ),
 [Tbl Name 2] ([col],[names],..) AS
 ( SQL )</pre>

Then use a standard DML statement after it!
