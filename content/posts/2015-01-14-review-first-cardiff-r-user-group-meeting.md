Last night was the first <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/" title="CaRdiff R User Group" target="_blank">Cardiff R User Group</a> event. There were 6 people registered out of 24 CaRdiffians. In the end we had 8 people show up &#8211; so a whopping third of our current membership base.

As we sat around the booth eating chips and drinking beer, we covered our experiences learning R to date, the trials and tribulations of our jobs and why you shouldn&#8217;t drop a barbell on your nose. We had great discussions and most of us came away with new R functionality to look at!

We decided to initially go with the three session formats I&#8217;d proposed and see how things go:

  * <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/events/219775500/" title="First TalkR session" target="_blank">TalkRs</a>: evening events with talks and socialising
  * <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/events/219691058/" title="First LearnRs session" target="_blank">LearnRs</a>: after work sessions focused on learning some new bit of R
  * <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/events/219476537/" title="First LunchRs session" target="_blank">LunchRs</a>: quick lunchtime sessions to talk through a problem with someone else and hopefully solve it!

With the TalkRs sessions, we had some solid ideas around topics like shiny, integrating into javascript, time series analysis and so forth. I can see that we&#8217;ll need to typically have a beginner oriented session and an intermediate/advanced session to balance the different levels of knowledge both in terms of r usage but also the areas of R usage.

The LearnRs promise to be heavily attended, and we&#8217;ll need some helpful folks who know their stuff to help the others learn.

All in all it was very positive, although I a bit angry with myself when I didn&#8217;t capture the moment with a pic! I look forward to our next meeting.
