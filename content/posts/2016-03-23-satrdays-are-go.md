I&#8217;m very pleased to say that the R Consortium agreed to the support the **satRday** project!

The idea [kicked off in November][1] and I was over the moon with the response from the community, then we [garnered support][2] before submitting to the Consortium and I must have looped the moon a few times as we had more than 500 responses. Now the [R Consortium are supporting us][3] and we can turn all that enthusiasm into action.

Over the next couple of weeks, we&#8217;ll be contacting everyone who has registered their interest in organising an event or helping with the tech & infrastructure side of things to get the ball rolling. There&#8217;s still time to [sign up][4] if you missed the initial call to action, and of course, we&#8217;re hoping that we won&#8217;t be stopping at three events and that we&#8217;ll be continuing these events for a very long time.
