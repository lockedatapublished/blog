[SQL Relay][1] is back on tour! Our 6th event sees us yet again touring the country bringing awesome speakers to eight cities over 2 weeks.

As usual we&#8217;re improving things:

  1. A new platform called [Attendee.Events][2] which allows easier registration & speaker submission
  2. A whole bunch of webinars planned to get in the swing of things
  3. More breadth &#8211; this year each event includes a dedicated track to R, machine learning etc, on top of SQL Server and business intelligence
  4. More content &#8211; instead of swapping out existing slots for breadth, we added more tracks
  5. A green initiative &#8230; see it on the day
  6. Improved speaker experience &#8211; we&#8217;re building on last year&#8217;s fun bus with the help of [SQL Sentry][3] to make it easier and more fun for speakers to do multiple events, as well as offering first timers some mentoring as most of the organisers are also speakers

You&#8217;ll see a lot of announcements about Relay over the next few months, but I hope this little post inspires you to check out [our events][1] 😀
