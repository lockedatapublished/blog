[Haveibeenpwned.com][1] is a fantastic service that helps people find out if they&#8217;ve been involved in a data breach. HIBPwned is an R wrapper for that service.

Recently, due to abuse of the system, Troy Hunt had to [add a limit][2] of one request per 1.5s.

The new version published on CRAN last night adds a delay into each call so that we can continue to use it in R.

Check out the [package on CRAN][3] for vignettes and more information on the package.
