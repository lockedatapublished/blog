As I covered in <a href="https://itsalocke.com/index.php/sqlsaturday-exeter-2015/" title="SQLSaturday Exeter 2015" target="_blank">my post on SQLSaturday Exeter</a>, I&#8217;m going to be doing a full day of R training on <a href="http://sqlsatexeter.azurewebsites.net/?page_id=342" title="SQLSaturday Exeter, Steph Locke Pre-con details" target="_blank">April 24th</a> that takes you from cabin boy to first mate in a day. You can&#8217;t be captain because I&#8217;m Captain&#8230; until you go back to your own ship&#8230; _then_ you can be captain.

## TL;DR

Attend my day of training about R if you&#8217;d like to learn R, best practices, and how to manage it.

It&#8217;s £150 (early bird) and can be booked at <a href="http://sqlsatexeter.azurewebsites.net/?page_id=342" title="SQLSaturday Exeter, Steph Locke Pre-con details" target="_blank">SQLSaturday Exeter&#8217;s website</a>

## Why should you learn R?

  * It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" title="R project" target="_blank">free</a>
  * It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.burns-stat.com/documents/tutorials/why-use-the-r-language/" title="Why use the R language?" target="_blank">fantastic</a>
  * It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/R.html" title="TIOBE R index" target="_blank">growing quickly</a>
  * It&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2015/01/revolution-acquired.html" title="Revolution bought by Microsoft" target="_blank">coming to a corporate ecosystem near you</a>
  * It&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2011/09/how-lloyds-of-london-uses-r-for-insurance.html" title="Lloyds of London using R" target="_blank">a competitive edge</a>
  * It&#8217;s <a href="http://pgbovine.net/research-programming-workflow.htm" title="The Phillip Test" target="_blank">more robust</a>

## What bits of R should you learn?

  1. R for data wrangling and analysis: learning how to do the basics enables you to do more complicated stuff on correctly formatted data that you&#8217;re confident in
  2. R for presenting findings: there&#8217;s no point being more effective at analysing data if you then C&P all your charts into Word
  3. R for reporting / data exploration: interactive reports and visualisations that inform the user
  4. R for stats: relevant to your industry and data, build statistical models that provide actionable insight

I&#8217;ve put things in the order I think you should tackle them. You should walk before you can run and if you can&#8217;t be confident in your data manipulation you can&#8217;t be confident about the resulting model.

## What bits of R would you learn from me?

You&#8217;ll learn the first three components as these are core tasks that won&#8217;t differ from company to company. Armed with the ability to wrangle your data, present and report on it, you&#8217;ll be able to get comfortable with the language. Once you&#8217;ve wowed people with faster turnaround times, better looking analysis, and more useful reports, the buy-in for &#8220;levelling up&#8221; and using R to do statistical modelling won&#8217;t be far behind. And what&#8217;s more, it&#8217;ll make you quicker, meaning more time to do more cool stuff!

## What will you get out of the pre-con?

You get to learn how to do nifty things in R and avoid a lot of the common pitfalls, tangents, and rocky moments involved in learning R.

The other part of the day is the pesky &#8220;robust implementation&#8221; bit. It&#8217;s not something that you might wish to know, but understanding how to build and maintain Linux servers in a Microsoft environment so that it&#8217;s AD authenticated, being backed up, and being monitored by SCOM, etc will give you the tools you need to either administer the servers yourself or to train your sys admins!

## Why you should pay to attend my pre-con?

I&#8217;ve struggled to write this post because discussing my training session involves telling _you_ why you should pay to listen to _me_. Talking about myself I find tough.. It&#8217;s easier to talk about how to do something than it is to talk about why you should accept my way of doing it. So instead of talking about me, I&#8217;m going to show you some of the feedback I&#8217;ve had from others and hope that speaks louder and more persuasively than I could.
