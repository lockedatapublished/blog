The SQL Server community has a lot of events. In the UK alone this year we will have/had in 2015:

  * more than 75 user group meetings
  * 5 SQL Saturdays
  * 8 days of Relay
  * 1 SQL in the City
  * 3 to 5 days of SQLBits
  * possibly a SQL Santa
  * and probably more that I&#8217;ve forgotten or not know about at the time of writing this

You could attend 2 days of conference per month (cpm from now on) on average in the UK alone, just at dedicated SQL events. That doesn&#8217;t even take into account all the awesome conferences running in the EU, and further afield. I think if you were a true #SQLConfJunky with unlimited budget, you&#8217;d be able to get your cpm up to at least 8.

I&#8217;m hovering around 1.5 cpm at present but looks set to increase. This feels quite high and whilst they&#8217;re a lot of fun I thought I&#8217;d better figure out the danger signs of over-conferencing!

On twitter & facebook I started collecting some danger signs:

  * You start expecting everyone to understand what your day-job is
  * Your wardrobe consists entirely of jeans and conference t-shirts
  * You see your SQL buddies from Holland more than you see your spouse
  * Every pad of paper, pen, and toy in sight is tech or hotel branded
  * You ask people to fill out feedback forms after every conversation
  * You try to download slides for a TV program
  * You feel naked without a lanyard
  * Lightning talks are how you teach your kids
  * You haven&#8217;t used a kettle in years
  * You get annoyed when you visit a place and they don&#8217;t give you a bag full of freebies
  * You think of danish pastries as a major food group

Do you have other amusing danger signs to add, or a story about when you over-conferenced? Please share it!
