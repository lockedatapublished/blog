Back in April, for SQL Saturday Exeter I ran [my first ever full day of training][1]. Next month sees me taking my second tilt at it.

To sign up for my R training day, July 24th, in Manchester you can go to the pre-con homepage.

If I may say so myself, it&#8217;s a steal at £99 but then they all are! For instance, Andrew Fryer&#8217;s training day covers the Machine Learning use of R via Azure, so if you&#8217;re already wrangling numbers like a pro in R, understanding how you can apply it to snazzy webservices is a great way to go.

## R training day mk1

Needless to say it was a steep learning curve for me.

I had a number of false start / procrastination projects that either took too long so had to be abandoned or were things I did to avoid working. One thing in particular that happened, is that even though I had allowed months for the development of the material, I still did not have enough time to do it as well as I&#8217;d have liked to. _[Parkinson&#8217;s Law anyone?][2]_

Despite all that, people were happy at the end of the day, I got useful feedback, and within 1 working day one of the attendees had built an R server, and was deploying a shiny application to it.

A superb result, that I&#8217;m still giddy over.

## R training day mk2

I&#8217;ve been cogitating about ways I can improve the day based on the feedback:

  * Homework: before the day folks will be expected to do all the installation needed (with tech support available via email of course)
  * Here&#8217;s one I made earlier: Have a configured Rstudio server that folks can connect to in the event they don&#8217;t do their homework or something goes wrong
  * Exercises: I was less structured than I could have been. I&#8217;ll be really beefing up this part
  * Show and tell: The whole point was to have something working by the end of the day. I&#8217;m going to focus on this more and ideally have people show their work
  * Cuts (maybe): The homework will give more time during the day but cutting some content is a good idea

So if you&#8217;d like to come along to a full day of training that has more Rs than the Kardashian&#8217;s, book now before all the spaces are gone!
