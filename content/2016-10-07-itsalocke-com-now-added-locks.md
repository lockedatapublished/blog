This blog now has some extra locks, these are in the URL bar!

It took my fantastic hosters [WPEngine][1] a little longer than I would have preferred to get a modern SSL policy. Now that they have, they did it in their typically awesome fashion. You can request a _free_ [Let&#8217;s Encrypt SSL][2] certificate from the admin dashboard, and configure how http etc should work in less than 15 minutes, and you don&#8217;t have be a web wizard to do it. It went seamlessly and caused no downtime.

My site is now completely covered by SSL. This is better in the eyes of myself, google, and the lock-loving world! If you&#8217;ve got a blog, you should look into adding SSL.

_Please note the link above is an affiliate link. I decided I like WP Engine&#8217;s service so much that I wouldn&#8217;t mind some money off my hosting by recommending it to y&#8217;all in a tracked way_
