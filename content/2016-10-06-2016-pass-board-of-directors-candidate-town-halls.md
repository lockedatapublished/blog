It&#8217;s PASS Board of Directors elections again! After a number of twitter discussions last week about the applicability of PASS outside of the US and what I think PASS is good and bad at, I thought I would engage the process instead of just being a complainy-pants. I attended all 6 town hall webinars and asked questions to all the candidates. I recommend you watch them before voting.

## Key messages from candidates

  * PASS covers the Microsoft data platform so if Microsoft expands it, PASS&#8217; content coverage should expand also
  * They&#8217;ve gained a lot of benefit through networking and contributing to PASS and they think we can all get that value

## Who am I likely to vote for?

There are three seats up for election this year, so we can cast three votes. I went into this hoping to increase the geographical diversity of the board&#8217;s perspectives. Eduardo is the **only** LATAM candidate so of course, he&#8217;s gonna get my vote for that seat. I&#8217;m also going to vote for Paresh &#8211; not only did he do well within his town hall but I think it will be valuable to have his additional representation for India and the rest of the APAC region. Of the others, I&#8217;m unsure &#8211; I think I&#8217;ll have to see the twitter debates later today to help make my decision!

## Thoughts on the process

I was very frustrated by the hurdle of 6 separate webinars that had to be registered for by attendees. These had a large amount of compulsory information and opted people in for marketing from PASS. PASS probably wanted each candidate to be able to prepare without interfering with the others, but with the ability to practice before a webinar starts I think it would have been better to make candidates verify their webcams etc up to 2 and half hours early than reduce the turnout they&#8217;d get.

[Grant Fritchey][14] deserves a big thank you for hosting these. He moderated 3 hours of webinar fantastically. He gave each candidate the treatment they deserved, which is super hard when you have to say the same things 6 times in a row and be on the ball for 3 hours. The continuity helped throughout but perhaps a deputy could have been of benefit.
