I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of web development recently, primarily via the magical [Hugo][1] platform. Between it and the [great themes][2] for it, it&#8217;s making website building fairly painless. Of course, each theme often needs customising to the relevant brand a given site is for. That customising is usually just one by some fonts and by tweaking the CSS.*

I&#8217;ve been relying on some old, and some very new, funky tools to help with CSS hacking and I thought I would share them, in case they should prove useful to you in the future.

  * Developer Tools (F12) &#8211; you need to be using this, it&#8217;s awesome. Love changes to CSS, finding the right element, checking inheritances, viewing errors, and more. There are so many posts out there that help boost your usage of this but [LMGTFY][3]
  * [CSS Linter][4] &#8211; for checking out whether your CSS has any problems like duplicate classes
  * [Hextractor][5] &#8211; for bringing out all the colour codes in use in some CSS. Very handy for viewing the palette or getting a list so you can easily replace values
  * [cssnext][6] &#8211; use the latest CSS features like variables (ZOMG!!) and get a converted to mainstream version. I used this to put colours at the top of a file, and reference them throughout to make changing theme a breeze
  * [Adobe Color][7] not strictly CSS but incredibly handy for building quick colour schemes based on a given colour

**What nifty sites and utilities am I missing for my CSS fudging? Please share your recommendations**

&#42; _By this I mean that I add a custom CSS sheet, which overrides any existing values for non-destructive CSSing_
