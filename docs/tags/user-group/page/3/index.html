                                <p>For some people it might sound silly, but a frequent reason why people don&#8217;t sign up or don&#8217;t make it to their local user group is to do with social anxiety. I totally understand this &#8211; a room full of people you don&#8217;t know can be a daunting experience. I still get nervous when attending a new user group for the first time and I run three user groups, and speak at user groups and conferences all round the country!</p>

<p>This post takes you through the worries, and explains how I&#8217;ve approached some of the issues. Hopefully, this&#8217;ll help you get more people in to your local user group and learning, whether it&#8217;s because you have the tools to help yourself, or understand and can help others.</p>

                                <p>I wanted to outline my approach to presentation design, or development as I prefer to call it.</p>

<p>Why do I consider it development? Well, it&#8217;s a product that can be manually done &amp; delivered but with the potential to scale to thousands of users, I&#8217;d rather the product be easy to maintain &amp; deploy, deliver real value to the users, and keep up with cutting edge developments in the subject. Also, I call it development because now with the use of <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/" title="Rmarkdown" target="_blank">rmarkdown</a>, I do actually code my presentations.</p>

<h2 id="general-presentation-design">General presentation design</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve read and studied a lot about presentations, some of the biggest influences being:</p>

<p>&#8211; Dr. Andrew Abela and the <a href="http://www.extremepresentation.com/" title="Extreme Presentation Method" target="_blank">Extreme Presentation Method</a></p>

<p>&#8211; <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/buckwoody/" title="Buck's blog" target="_blank">Buck Woody</a> and his fantastic presentation style</p>

<p>&#8211; <a href="http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2012/04/writing-better-conference-abstracts-presentations/" title="Brent's blog" target="_blank">Brent Ozar</a> and his excellent materials for presentations</p>

<p>&#8211; Solid fundamentals in presentation training courses (things like INTRO: Intro, Need, Title, Range, Objective)</p>

<p>When I first come up with the idea for a presentation, I write the abstract for it. In the abstract I set out the tone, material covered, and outline who should attend. This abstract is my requirements doc for later me &#8211; it tells me whether I&#8217;m selling, educating, or entertaining and what I&#8217;m doing it about.</p>

<p>In my opinion, you should always write the abstract first as not only can you write more abstracts than you can presentations but it distills the idea down and helps you think of your audience first.</p>

                                <p>Last night was the first <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/" title="CaRdiff R User Group" target="_blank">Cardiff R User Group</a> event. There were 6 people registered out of 24 CaRdiffians. In the end we had 8 people show up &#8211; so a whopping third of our current membership base.</p>

<p>As we sat around the booth eating chips and drinking beer, we covered our experiences learning R to date, the trials and tribulations of our jobs and why you shouldn&#8217;t drop a barbell on your nose. We had great discussions and most of us came away with new R functionality to look at!</p>

<p>We decided to initially go with the three session formats I&#8217;d proposed and see how things go:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/events/219775500/" title="First TalkR session" target="_blank">TalkRs</a>: evening events with talks and socialising</li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/events/219691058/" title="First LearnRs session" target="_blank">LearnRs</a>: after work sessions focused on learning some new bit of R</li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/events/219476537/" title="First LunchRs session" target="_blank">LunchRs</a>: quick lunchtime sessions to talk through a problem with someone else and hopefully solve it!</p>

<p>There are a massive amount of awesome SQL Server and other technology events happening out there. I even throw a SQL Server lunchtime session once a week for the user group! Then of course there&#8217;s all those conferences in the UK and abroad that are worth attending. So how do I event start picking out where I&#8217;d like to talk, and how do I go about getting selected for them?</p>

                                Not quite part of being organised at speaking, but bundled up in part of my scheduling constraints for speaking is when I&#8217;m throwing user group events. Here&#8217;s the details of the user groups I&#8217;m planning on throwing to meet my goal of 1 user group event a month (not including lunch time sessions!)
SQL Server I run the SQL Server user group in Cardiff and have done a few years &#8211; I&#8217;m not giving it up any time soon.

                                <p>These days any hobby of mine ends up with a user group if there isn&#8217;t one already.</p>

<p>The amount of value I derive from being able to hear experts in their fields talk about whether they&#8217;re on stage or in the audience is phenomenal. Also, it&#8217;s really great way to meet like-minded people.</p>

<p>So with the benefits in mind, 2 years of R under my belt, and a new starter in work, the time seemed ripe for an <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/" target="_blank"  title="Cardiff R">R user group</a>.</p>

                                <p>Following up from my last post on <a href="https://itsalocke.com/index.php/organised-speaking-session-abstracts/" title="Organised speaking – session abstracts" target="_blank">maintaining my session abstracts</a>, I wanted to cover how I&#8217;m doing my scheduling this year for speaking at events. Perhaps more importantly than tech, is the intention and the planning process so I&#8217;ll be covering these factors in more detail than the tech.</p>

<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>

<p>I make use of Google services quite a bit, and their <a href="http://calendar.google.com" title="Google calendar">calendar</a> system is a great help. So this year I&#8217;ve added a calendar that has all mine (and hopefully Oz&#8217;s) speaking engagements.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m then utilising a WordPress plugin called <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gcal-events-list/" title="Gcal events">GCal events</a> to connect to the calendar and pull the info into a <a href="https://itsalocke.com/index.php/wheres-steff-oz/" title="Where’s Steff &amp; Oz?">page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="throw-1-speak-1">Throw 1, Speak 1</h2>

<p>The goal this year is to throw one user group event and speak at one event each month.</p>

                                <p>Last year I spoke at 10&nbsp;different events (I think) and was very lucky to be nominated in the Tribal Awards for my Intro to R session. I did just a couple of different session titles and I don&#8217;t think I managed the whole process very well.</p>

<p>To be an easier speaker to deal with, I&#8217;m trying to be more organised so that the selection process of myself &amp; topics is easier whilst also ensuring I don&#8217;t develop too many presentations at the last minute.</p>

<p>Having dealt with awesome serial speakers, <a href="http://koprowskit.eu/geek/" target="_blank">Tobiasz Koprowski</a> and <a href="http://dcac.co/" target="_blank">Denny Cherry</a>, from the organiser end they did a few things which made it much easier to deal with them, particularly given the breadth of topics they can cover!</p>
