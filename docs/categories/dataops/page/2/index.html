                                I&#8217;m sure that all my PoSh friends out there, who use Azure and PowerShell all the time probably know this already but I thought I&#8217;d share a little snippet of hard-won knowledge.
 When you put an Azure Storage Account into a Resource Group, you can no longer use the default Azure.Storage module. Instead, you&#8217;ve got to use the AzureRM.Storage module.
 All the scripts I encountered whilst googling how to connect to blob storage via PowerShell, including the ones in the script gallery within Azure Automation seemed to all assume the azure storage account you wanted to connect to was standalone.

                                <p><strong>UPDATE 2016-10-21 : You can now get the ODBC 13 driver for Linux with a much smoother install process than below. Get all the relevant information on <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlnativeclient/2016/10/20/odbc-driver-13-0-for-linux-released/">the announcement from the Microsoft SQLNCli team blog</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Did you know you can now get <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/server-cloud/sql-server-on-linux.aspx">SQL Server ODBC drivers for Ubuntu</a>? Yes, no, maybe? It&#8217;s ok even if you haven&#8217;t since it&#8217;s pretty new! Anyway, this presents me with an ideal opportunity to standardise my SQL Server ODBC connections across the operating systems I use R on i.e. Windows and Ubuntu. My first trial was to get it working on <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis-CI</a> since that&#8217;s where all my training magic happens and if it can&#8217;t work on a clean build like Travis, then where can it work? Alas, the ODBC 13 driver doesn&#8217;t work Ubuntu 14.04 so this set of instructions has been modified to provide code for Ubuntu 15.04 only.</p>

<h2 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>It works, but it&#8217;s really hacky right now. Definitely looking forward to the next iterations of this driver.</p>

<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>

<ul>
<li>This will work for Ubuntu 15.04 but 14.04 has a different set of C compilers</li>
<li>This is currently hacky, and Microsoft are on the case for improving it so this post could quickly become out of date.</li>
<li>Be very careful installing the driver on an existing machine. Due to the overwriting of unixODBC if already installed and potential compatibility issues with other driver managers you may have installed.</li>
</ul>

                                <p>We&#8217;re in the fantastic situation where lots of people are using <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a> to test their R packages or use it to test and deploy their analytics/ documentation / anything really. It&#8217;s popularity has been having a negative side-effect recently though! GitHub <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting">rate limits</a> API access to 5000 requests per hour so sometimes there are more R related jobs running on Travis per hour than this limit, causing builds to error typically with a message that includes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>403 forbidden</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This error will cause your build to fail, even if you didn&#8217;t do anything wrong. To solve it short-term you can wait a little while and restart your build.<figure id="attachment_61598" style="width: 768px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"></p>

<p><img class="size-medium_large wp-image-61598" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/lockedata/image/upload/h_131,w_750/v1499850336/restartbuilds_hsvpmp.png" alt="How to restart a build in Travis-CI" width="768" height="134" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">How to restart a build in Travis-CI</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>That is a very short-termist solution and does not solve the problem for future you or other users of the service. The real solution to resolving this issue is to get off the default API access credentials and use your own.</p>

<p>The R integration in Travis makes good use of the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools">devtools</a>. The devtools package looks for an environment variable called <code>GITHUB_PAT</code> that holds a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/">personal access token</a> (PAT) for using the GitHub API and if it doesn&#8217;t find one it uses a default token. When we get our own PAT and store it in Travis, devtools will pick up our token and use it, meaning you&#8217;ll only ever get rate limited if you do more than 5000 builds in an hour, which is an achievement I&#8217;d love to hear about.</p>

                                <p>As part of my never-ending quest to deploy documentation better, I&#8217;ve made yet another tweak to my scripts that deploy R vignettes or Rmarkdown documents to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch of my github repositories via Travis-CI.</p>

<p>The script from <a href="http://rmflight.github.io/posts/2014/11/travis_ci_gh_pages.html">Robert Flight</a> that&#8217;s provided the basis for most of this work does something specific to update the web facing branch of the repository. It would:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a blank repository</p></li>

<li><p>Add the requisite files to the repository</p></li>

<li><p>Add and commit them to the repo</p></li>

<li><p>Force the repo to overwrite the <code>gh-pages</code> branch</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This had the unfortunate consequence of losing the history of what was previously hosted on the branch and could not tell me what commit to my development branches was responsible for a version of the docs. It took a little bit of playing but the revised script now:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Clones the gh-pages branch</p></li>

<li><p>Adds the requisite files into the reports</p></li>

<li><p>Add and commit them to the repo</p></li>

<li><p>Push the changes</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Using an environment variable ($TRAVIS_COMMIT) the commit message is the commit ID for the latest commit in the build that occurs on Travis, making it very easy to see what changes triggered a documentation update.</p>

It is, however, a pain to open PuTTY and log in all the time, mainly because I couldn&#8217;t script it in R! It&#8217;s been a trial, but like most things it turned out to be pretty simple in the end so I thought I&#8217;d share it with you.</p>

                                <p>When I&#8217;m building stuff in R like packages, models, etc. I find myself wishing for realistic looking test data without having to resort to getting data off my production server. To that end I&#8217;ve been on the hunt for a way of generating decent test data. A few months back I stumbled upon the neat system <a href="https://www.mockaroo.com/">Mockaroo</a> which provides a GUI to build some data that suits your needs.</p>

<p>Mockaroo is a really impressive service with a wide spread of different data types. They also have simple ways of adding things like within group differences to data so that you can mock realistic class differences. They use the freemium model so you can get a thousand rows per download, which is pretty sweet. The big BUT you can feel coming on is this &#8211; it&#8217;s a GUI! I don&#8217;t want to have spend time hand cranking a data extract.</p>

<p>Thankfully, they have a GUI for getting data too and it&#8217;s pretty simply to use so I&#8217;ve started making a package for it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve started the package on <a href="https://github.com/stephlocke/mockaRoo">github</a> and will be developing it over the next month or two. It&#8217;s up and working, but only in the most primitive way as I&#8217;d like to get some feedback from folks who might find this useful around how the interface for generating your desired data schema should work.</p>

                                About Anchor Modelling Anchor Modelling moves you beyond third normal form and into sixth normal form. What does this mean?
 Not sure about the normal forms? See the normalization process in actions with this normalisation example
 Essentially it means that an attribute is stored independently against the key, not in a big table with other attributes. This means you can easily store metadata about that attribute and do full change tracking with ease.

                                In my last post on using GitHub, Travis-CI, and rmarkdown/knitr for automatically building and deploying documentation, I covered how I was able to do it with a containerised approach so things were faster. I also said my Rtraining repository was still too brittle to blog about. This has changed &#8211; WOO HOO!
The main thanks for that goes out to the new package ezknitr from Dean Attali. ezknitr takes the pain out of working directories, making my hierarchies much more resilient.
