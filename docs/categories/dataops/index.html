                                I mentioned in an earlier post about how I&#8217;m revamping my presentation slides process but that I hadn&#8217;t tackled the user experience of browsing my slides, which wasted lots of the effort I put in. To tackle this part of it, I&#8217;ve made lockedata.uk using Hugo to be a way of finding and browsing presentations on R, SQL, and more. As Hugo is so easy, I thought I&#8217;d throw in a quick Hugo walkthrough too so that you could build your own blog/slides/company site if you wanted to.

                                T-SQL TuesdayFor T-SQL Tuesday #91 the topic is databases and devops. Grant Fritchey asks us:
 How do we approach DevOps as developers, DBAs, report writers, analysts and database developers? How do we deal with data persistence, process, source control and all the rest of the tools and mechanisms, and most importantly, culture, that would enable us to get better, higher functioning teams put together? Please, tell me your DevOps stories.

                                High-level info If you build a model and never update it you&#8217;re missing a trick. Behaviours change so your model will tend to perform worse over time. You&#8217;ve got to regularly refresh it, whether that&#8217;s adjusting the existing model to fit the latest data (recalibration) or building a whole new model (retraining), but this means you&#8217;ve got new versions of your model that you have to handle. You need to think about your methodology for versioning R model objects, ideally before you lose any versions.

                                In this post, I describe the latest iteration of my automatic document production with R. It improves upon the methods used in Rtraining, and previous work on this topic can read by going to the auto deploying R documentation tag.
I keep banging on about this area because reproducible research / analytical document pipelines is an area I&#8217;ve a keen interest in. I see it as a core part of DataOps as it&#8217;s vital for helping us ensure our models and analysis are correct in data science and boosting our productivity.

                                I recently delivered a day of training at SQLBits and I really upped my game in terms of infrastructure for it. The resultant solution was super smooth and mitigated all the install issues and preparation for attendees. This meant we got to spend the whole day doing R, instead of troubleshooting.
I&#8217;m so happy with the solution for an online R training environment that I want to share the solution, so you can take it and use it for when you need to do training.

My NDC London talk Data + Docker = Disconbobulating? cover the basics and architectural decisions. In my podcast spot Data and Docker on .Net Rocks we go into more depth about the architectural decisions facing you when working with data and Docker.

I was failing because the docs outside C# (and node.js) were so limited that I found it difficult to get things done. However, I persevered and overcame a little bit of C#-ophobia and I can honestly say it has been so worth it.

                                <p>From code in answers on Stack Overflow to R packages or full programs, there&#8217;s a lot of code being written and given away. This post examines some of the reasons why the people writing all that code do it, why you should consider giving back with code, and how you can get started. Finally, I cap it all off with perspectives from some of my favourite coders!</p>

<li><a href="#perspectives">Perspectives</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reasons">Because reasons</h2>

<p>There are many reasons why you should consider writing code and making it available for public consumption.</p>

<h3 id="altruistic">Altruistic</h3>

<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re writing something to achieve a task, odds are someone else would have to write the same code &#8211; why not help them out?</li>
<li>You&#8217;re using a lot of open source software, whether you realise it or not. By open sourcing your code, you get to pay it forward</li>
<li>To give others something to contribute to</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="career">Career</h3>

<ul>
<li>Unknown quantities are risky hires, put your code out there for the world to see and employers get to see what you can do</li>
<li>Develop your skills for the next job, the one that requires you to be more skilled in something than you are now</li>
<li>You get to interact with a lot of different people who you build credibility with, and hopefully friendships!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="for-oneself">For oneself</h3>

<ul>
<li>Generally speaking, the more code you write, the better your coding skills so if you want to improve your skills this is an ideal way to do it</li>
<li>For the sheer fun of doing cool stuff, especially if you don&#8217;t get to do cool stuff in the day job</li>
<li>To do it &#8220;the way it should be done&#8221;</li>
</ul>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve recently been trying to solve the challenge of working extracting files from AWS and getting them into Azure in my desired format. I wanted a solution that kept everything on the cloud and completely avoid local tin. I wanted it to have built-in auditing and error handling. I wanted something whizzy and new, to be honest! One way in which I attempted to tackle the task was with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/automation/">Azure Automation</a>. In this post, I&#8217;ll overview Automation and explore how it stacked up for what I was attempting to use it for.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall Task: Get compressed (.tar.gz) files from AWS S3 to Azure, decompress the files, concatenate the contents and put in a different container for analytics magic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like with most things I dropped myself into the deep-end on it so had fairly minimal knowledge of PowerShell and the Azure modules, therefore I fully expect more knowledgeable folks to wince at my stuff. General advice, &#8220;you should do it like this, then this&#8230;&#8221;&#8216;s, and resource recommendations are all very welcome &#8211; leave a comment with them in!</p>

<h2 id="azure-automation">Azure Automation</h2>

<p>Azure Automation is essentially a hosted PowerShell script execution service. It seems to be aimed primarily at managing Azure resources, particularly via <a href="https://www.simple-talk.com/sysadmin/powershell/powershell-desired-state-configuration-the-basics/">Desired State Configurations</a>.</p>

<p>It is, however, a general PowerShell powerhouse, with scheduling capabilities and a bunch of useful features for the safe storage of credentials etc. This makes it an excellent tool if you&#8217;re looking to do something with PowerShell on a regular basis and need to interact with Azure.</p>
